# Summary

Randobet is a decentralized betting platform on the Celo blockchain. The goal is to create a professional, modern, and simple logo and favicon that represents the brand's core concepts without using the "Randobet" text.

The logo's key concepts include **randomness** (using chaotic or spinning elements), **betting** (with subtle hints of chips or cards), and the ideas of **profitability** (golden accents) and **risk**. It should also embody a sense of **curiosity** with a mystical, otherworldly feel.

The visual style should be **modern and minimalistic**, featuring a primary **purple and orange color palette** with gradients and glow effects. The design should also incorporate a subtle **blockchain aesthetic** with geometric or chain-like elements.

The final icon must be **scalable** and versatile enough to function as a tiny 16x16px favicon as well as a large banner. It should be easily recognizable on both light and dark backgrounds, maintaining a high-tech and trustworthy look that appeals to both crypto and traditional betting users.



For the code present, 1. Modify the DisclaimerModal.tsx and core aspect of the project so that user cannot access any of the features if they reject the disclaimer. 2. Let's modify the project's theme and colors. Use Celoâ€™s brand palette and typography to modify the project to have a bold, high-contrast, raw interface. Emphasize big color blocks, sharp edges, and visible structure. Typography is a core visual element. Use a limited, high-contrast palette centered on bold Celo brand colors: bright yellow #FCFF52, violet #7c3aed, and dark stone color present in tailwind.config.ts #713f12, supported by light tan neutrals (#FBF6F1, #E6E3D5), brown #635949, black, and white. Reserve accentsâ€”pink #F2A9E7, orange #F29E5F, lime #B2EBA1, light blue #8AC0F9â€”for small punches of energy only. No soft pastels, no subtle gradients; if a gradient is used, it must be stark and hard-edged. Typography must dominate visually. Use GT Alpina for headlines: oversized, thin-weight, tight letter-spacing, with italicized words for emphasis. Use Inter for body text and labels: clean, geometric, and heavy when needed (e.g., 750 weight for links or tags). Headlines should feel architectural and can stretch across the page. Body copy should read like industrial signage. Layout is raw and structural. Favor big color blocks, sharp rectangles, and visible outlines. Break the grid with asymmetry and unexpected spacing. Alternate between vast negative space and dense, blocky sections. Componentsâ€”buttons, inputs, cardsâ€”must be rectangular and unsoftened. Use bold color inversions on hover (e.g., black text on yellow flips to yellow text on black). Icons should be minimal, geometric, and functional.

Overall tone: unpolished, striking, unapologetic. The UI should feel engineered and intentional rather than decorative.

Think poster-like screens where color, type, and negative space themselves are the interface. 3. Modify the SelfQRCodeVerifier component design, theme and colors to match the project's. Do not alter the verification logic. Avoid leaving unused variables in file. Avoid code that could lead to Division by zero error. Laslty, update the PROGRESS file
